# 💎 Nivoda Design System

## 📦 Packages

-   🏎 [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo) — High-performance build system for Monorepos

## 🛠️ Tools

-   [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
-   [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
-   [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

## 🚀 Commands

-   `pnpm build` - Build all packages
-   `pnpm dev` - Run all packages locally
-   `pnpm lint` - Lint all packages
-   `pnpm clean` - Clean up all `node_modules` and `dist` folders (runs each package's clean script)

## Turborepo

[Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo) is a high-performance build system for JavaScript and TypeScript codebases. It was designed after the workflows used by massive software engineering organizations to ship code at scale. Turborepo abstracts the complex configuration needed for monorepos and provides fast, incremental builds with zero-configuration remote caching.

Using Turborepo simplifies managing your design system monorepo, as you can have a single lint, build, test, and release process for all packages. [Learn more](https://vercel.com/blog/monorepos-are-changing-how-teams-build-software) about how monorepos improve your development workflow.

## Apps & Packages

This Turborepo includes the following packages and applications:

-   `packages/typescript-config`: Shared `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the Turborepo
-   `packages/eslint-config`: ESLint preset
-   `packages/design-tokens`: Design tokens for the design system. Style Dictionary is used to generate the tokens
-   `packages/mui-theme`: MUI custom theme that uses the design tokens to style the MUI components
-   `pacakges/ui`: React components that use the MUI theme and stories to showcase the components in Storybook
-   `apps/storybook`: Storybook app that uses the UI package to showcase the components
-   `apps/react`: React app playground for testing the components
-   `packages/caret`: CLI utility for generating components

Each package and app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). Workspaces enables us to "hoist" dependencies that are shared between packages to the root `package.json`. This means smaller `node_modules` folders and a better local dev experience. To install a dependency for the entire monorepo, use the `-w` workspaces flag with `pnpm add`.
